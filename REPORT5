xsh$ 

List of implementations:

1) Created the header file include/future.h having the following
	States, modes, future data structure definition, prototype of the system calls future_alloc(), future_free(), future_get(), future_set().
	Also contains prototype for future_prod(), future_cons().
2) Modified xsh_prodcons.c such that when -f is passed as argument, futures are used and not semaphores.

3) apps/future_prod.c : produces an integer and calls future_set().

4) apps/future_cons.c : calls future_get(), prints the consumed integer.	

5) system calls: definition of the 4 system calls future_alloc(), future_free(), future_get(), future_set().

6) myqueue.c myqueue.h : Files for queue manipulation used by future.

7) future.h: changes in futent data structure for the queue.

All the tasks has been done collaboratively by us.
